Description:

vBulletin addon. Some tweeks so simplify moderation:

1. Hide expired infractions from users
2. Enable moderators to see all infraction details in profile
3. Enable moderators to see all deleted posts/threads
4. Disable moderators to give infractions not in their forums
5. Cleanup very old expired infractions, to keep history smart
